# Advanced-Offset


Fully rewritten for cleaner faster reading, writing, drug abuse and the like.
New less fancy UI, but it gets the job done
High DPI support.
No offsets are hard coded any more, all are stored in text files in the sub directory 'Offsets'
Layout of said offsets are Name=Offset

For PGE export ability the files name currently have to be either 'FRpge.txt' or 'EMpge.txt' this will be changed in the future.

Now it technically supports all GBA Roms, Pokemon and not. But for now I have it only setup for FireRed and Emerald, more generic titles and proper support for other games will be added soonish.

I may have broken Costura so you currently need all the files that are contained in the zip file in the same folder as the program.

Testing on this version has been limited as I only have my Windows 10 laptop on hand.
